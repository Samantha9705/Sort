# Sort

I learned a few algorithms for sorting a sequence of numbers: selection sort, bubble sort, and merge sort.

Selection sort iterates through the unsorted portions of a list, selecting the smallest element each time and moving it to its correct location.
Bubble sort compares pairs of adjacent values one at a time and swaps them if they are in the incorrect order. This continues until the list is sorted.
Merge sort recursively divides the list into two repeatedly and then merges the smaller lists back into a larger one in the correct order.

In this problem, Iâ€™ll analyze three (compiled) sorting programs to determine which algorithms they use.
In a file called answers.txt in a folder called sort, I record my answers, along with an explanation for each program.
